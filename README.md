Notes

* Due to WebGL security restrictions, this must be run from an HTTP server;
opening index.html locally will not work properly! This simplest way to do
this is with Python: _python -m SimpleHTTPServer_

* We use Pixi.js as our rendering engine! The documentation is available at
[http://www.goodboydigital.com/pixijs/docs/](http://www.goodboydigital.com/pixijs/docs/).
